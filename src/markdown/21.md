projectName: "21"
description:
    [
        "Created as part of LaunchSchool's JavaScript 101 assessment. The aim was the create a terminal-based game that 
        follows the rules of 21, or 'Black Jack'. Input is accepted via readline-sync, and all logic is handled in small, 
        atomic functions.",

        "As an extra challenge, I decided to make the cards 'graphical', as the initial assessment criteria was just to 
        display them as a letter/number and the suit, e.g. Kâ™¥.",
