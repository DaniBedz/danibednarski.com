        "As part of Generation Australia's web developer program, we used pair programming and agile methodology and create 
        a to-do app. Our app utilises Firebase for authorisation, as well as storing task data in a database.",

        "This was the first time I had worked collaboratively with a partner. It was a great experience as I got to try out 
        VS Code Live Share as part of the development process. This allowed us to work on some problems at the same time in 
        a more efficient way than just screen sharing.",

        "I wasn't happy with the browser's standard date picker, so I integrated Flatpickr to offer a better user experience. 
        I also added notifications using AlertifyJS."
