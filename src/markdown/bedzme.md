title: "A Simple Link Shortener Service"
description:
    [
        "I decided to make a link shortener service as I have always wondered how they worked and owned a short domain from a previous project. 
        This was a great learning experience as I got the chance to manage my own virtual webserver, work directly with a MySQL database, as well 
        as make something that I use almost everyday.",

        "This project makes use of the excellent YOURLS PHP framework which does most of the heavy lifting. The main work on this project involved 
        the configuration of the nginx web server, which needed some tweaking to get the required path redirects to work correctly. I also 
        installed some plugins to customise the functionality, as well as created the minimal-style frontend."
