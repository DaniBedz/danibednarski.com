        "Created as part of LaunchSchool's JavaScript 101 assessment. A tic-tac-toe game with logic for an 
        intelligent opponent.",

        "As an extra challenge, I added in some logic to make it difficult, but not impossible to win. For example, the 
        computer player will try to target the middle square if it is untaken as it offers a clear advantage."
