After hearing about Svelte on the Syntax podcast, I decided to give it a try. I am in love üòç.

After completing the documentation tutorial, purchasing and finishing a few courses, I created this site to cement my learning.

The site uses Sveltekit for SSR, and the project pages are dynamically created from markup files via MDsveX.

I took my inspiration from the Discord layout, with the project icons serving as apps in the app bar on the left. 
The green indicator dots on the GitHub and LinkedIn icons denote that it is an external link.",

I haven't used a form framework before either, so I decided to implement a contact form using 'Felte', which I 
chose due to the minimal, clean syntax.

## Technologies Used: 
Svelte
Sveltekit
MDsveX
Felte
